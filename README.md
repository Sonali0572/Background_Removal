# Foreground_Object_Extraction
Replacing the background of an image with solid black colour using Mask-RCNN.
The model works for an input image, for which it mask the person and replace the rest of the background with solid black background. Also, it works well on real-time images by creating a mask over the person.
The sample input image and the corresponding outputs with mask and with solid black background is added to the folder.
Further, any background based on the user's choice can be used instead of solid colour.
This kind of model can be applied to various video conferencing platforms.
